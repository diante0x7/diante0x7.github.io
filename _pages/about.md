Hello! I am Diante Jackson, a first-year student at the University of Houston, pursuing a double major B.S. in Computer Science and Political Science! I am extremely passionate about Information Security, whether it be Penetration Testing, Malware/C2 Development, Security Operations or DevOps! I also have a shrewd understanding of intelligence analysis and collection, whether it be OSINT, FININT, or VISINT. I obtained my CompTIA PenTest+ CE in 2021 and I'm currently pursuing both the Splunk Certified Defense Analyst and CompTIA CASP+ certifications.

What do I do?
======
As of right now, I head a national student-led and based organization called the Rolan Group. We focus on intelligence analysis and penetration testing as a means to prevent attacks before they occur by properly emulating the adversarial mindset, as well as conducting research and development as often as possible.

I also currently lead the Workshops team and co-lead the Capture the Flag team at CougarCS, the largest student-run organization at the University of Houston. My contributions go above and beyond, establishing initiatives for the future and holding the responsibility of developing the next generation of information security talent.

This responsibility has led me to create The Academy, a series of weekly lectures and workshops dedicated to building a well-rounded professional skillset in all disciplines of Information Security, free of charge and available to all!

What Now?
======
I am currently pursuing spring and summer '24 opportunies in:
- Penetration Testing
- Security Engineering
- Intelligence/Investigation
- Software Development
